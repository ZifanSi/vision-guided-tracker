# High Performance Vision-Guided Camera Tracker  

**Developer Names**: Zifan Si, Jianqing Liu, Mike Chen, Xiaotian Lou  
**Supervisor**: Shahin Sirouspour  

Date of project start: September 8th 2025  

**Project Overview**: The goal of this project is to design and implement a deployable camera tracking system capable of autonomously locking onto and following extremely fast-moving small targets, such as model rockets. The system integrates computer vision, motion control, and a web-based operator interface to deliver smooth, stable video (1080p @ 60fps) of critical rocket events such as staging and parachute deployment.  

This project builds a software stack that interfaces with low-cost hardware for small-scale launches (200m apogee) and is scalable to support the McMaster Rocketry Teamâ€™s high-powered rockets (3km+ apogee).
