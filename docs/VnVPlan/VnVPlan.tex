\wss{The intention of the VnV plan is to increase confidence in the software.
  However, this does not mean listing every verification and validation technique
  that has ever been devised.  The VnV plan should also be a \textbf{feasible}
  plan. Execution of the plan should be possible with the time and team available.
  If the full plan cannot be completed during the time available, it can either be
  modified to ``fake it'', or a better solution is to add a section describing
  what work has been completed and what work is still planned for the future.}

This Verification and Validation (V\&V) plan outlines how the RoCam project
will demonstrate that the system is built correctly (verification) and fits
stakeholder needs (validation). It anchors testing to the SRS, architecture
(MG), and detailed design (MIS), ensuring every requirement is traceable to one
or more tests. Verification relies on structured reviews, checklists, and
staged testing (unit, integration, and system) to confirm functional behavior,
performance expectations, interface consistency, and safety assumptions.
Validation complements this with stakeholder walkthroughs, task-based
inspections, and controlled field or demo sessions to confirm the system’s
real-world suitability and operator workflow. Roles and responsibilities are
assigned to team members and the supervisor to keep eviews focused and
accountable, with feedback captured and tracked. Priorities emphasize
correctness, performance, reliability, and safety; lower-priority or
out-of-scope items (e.g., exhaustive usability studies or independent
verification of third-party components) are noted to keep the plan feasible.
The document concludes with traceability tables, placeholders for unit-level
details after design finalization, and appendices for parameters and optional
surveys—forming a clear, practical roadmap for building credible evidence of
quality.

\hl{TODO: tidy up deliverables list}

  Verification and Validation plan}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

The RoCam system is a ground-based camera and gimbal assembly designed to
autonomously track model rockets during launch and flight. It utilizes a
high-resolution camera coupled with a motorized gimbal to maintain visual lock
on the rocket, providing real-time data and video feed. The system consists of
a STM32 based motion controller that interfaces with the physical gimbal; a
Jetson compute module that processes the camera feed; and a react frontend that
displays the video preview and allows the user to control the gimbal. The
primary purpose of RoCam is to replace the traditional unreliable manual
tracking methods with an automated solution to produce high-quality flight data
and video footage. To better assist model rocket teams across Canada to conduct
successful launches by providing an affordable and reliable system that can be
easily track launching movements.

\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
  its general functions.}

\subsection{Objectives}
The primary objective of this Verification and Validation V\&V Plan is to
establish confidence in the correctness, performance, and reliability of the
RoCam system by ensuring that all verification and validation activities are
thorough, traceable, and aligned with project requirements. The plan emphasizes
testing and peer review to confirm that functional and performance criteria are
fully addressed, with improvements tracked through GitHub Issues. Validation
focuses on both automated and field testing to confirm that the system performs
as intended in real-world launch conditions. These qualities—correctness,
performance, reliability, and traceability—are fundamental to the success of
the V\&V process, ensuring that the RoCam system is both technically sound and
operationally dependable. Certain objectives, such as independent verification
of third-party hardware and extended usability testing, are excluded due to
scope and resource limitations, with reliance placed on manufacturer and
stakeholder validation.

\subsection{In-Scope Objectives}
Verification and validation efforts will prioritize the following qualities:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Correctness:} Ensure the reliability of tracking and control
        algorithms through testing and validation.
  \item \textbf{Performance:} Achieve real-time processing of 1080p 60\,fps
        video and maintain minimal gimbal control latency.
  \item \textbf{Safety:} Guarantee that the system operates safely under
        assumed conditions, with fail-safe mechanisms.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Out-of-Scope Objectives}
The following objectives are excluded from this project due to time, budget,
and resource constraints:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Comprehensive Usability Testing:} User experience will be evaluated
        informally via team and client feedback rather than large-scale formal studies.
  \item \textbf{Third-Party Component Verification:} External hardware such as the
        gimbal controller and camera are assumed to perform according to their
        manufacturer specifications.
  \item \textbf{Scalability Beyond Small-Scale Rockets:} Tracking a
        bullet or extremely difficult
        targets beyond a model rocket is outside the scope of this project.
\end{itemize}

By defining these priorities and exclusions, the RoCam project ensures that
available effort is directed toward validating the most critical system
qualities: \textbf{performance, accuracy, and operational safety}.

\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}

\wss{You should also list the objectives that are out of scope.  You don't have
  the resources to do everything, so what will you be leaving out.  For instance,
  if you are not going to verify the quality of usability, state this.  It is also
  worthwhile to justify why the objectives are left out.}

\wss{The objectives are important because they highlight that you are aware of
  limitations in your resources for verification and validation.
  You can't do everything, so what are you going to prioritize?
  As an example, if your system depends on an external library,
  you can explicitly state that you will assume that external library
  has already been verified by its implementation team.}

\subsection{Extras}

\subsubsection*{Extras}
Beyond the core objectives, the RoCam project includes several
extras that enhance its quality and usability:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{STM32 control circuit design:} Development of a
        custom control circuit to interface the gimbal actuators with
        the host computer, enabling precise motion control and feedback sensing.
  \item \textbf{User Instructional Video:} Creation of a short instructional
        video demonstrating system setup, calibration, and operation to support
        new users and ensure safe deployment.
\end{itemize}

These extras aim to improve the overall usability, accessibility, and
documentation quality of the final deliverable, reinforcing RoCam's emphasis on
practical integration between computer vision software, mechanical control, and
end-user experience.

\wss{State the challenge level (advanced, general, basic) for your project.
  Your challenge level should exactly match what is included in your problem
  statement.  This should be the challenge level agreed on between you and the
  course instructor.  You can use a pull request to update your challenge level
  (in TeamComposition.csv or Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the
  VnV planning exercise.}

\wss{Summarize the extras (if any) that were tackled by this project.  Extras
  can include usability testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal
  proof, GenderMag personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Extras should have already
  been approved by the course instructor as included in your problem statement.
  You can use a pull request to update your extras (in TeamComposition.csv or
  Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the VnV planning exercise.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\textbf{Software Requirements Specification (\SRS~\cite{SRS}):}
The SRS document serves as a outline for the VnV plan. The SRS document
contains specific functional and non-functional requirements, performance
criteria, and constraints. The SRS document also contains detailed stakeholder
roles and scope of the work. Aligning the VnV plan with the SRS document ensures
that all specified requirements are adequately verified and validated.

\textbf{Software Architecture MG (\MG~\cite{MG}) }
The MG document provides details of our system architecture. To effectively design
tests to validate and verify the system, it is important to understand the
architecture and functionality of each module.

\textbf{Software Detailed Design Document (MIS~\cite{MIS}):}
The MIS document provides detailed design of our system. It provides critical information
about the implementation details, including data structures, algorithms, and interfaces.
This document is essential for efficient test design to specific modules.

\wss{Reference relevant documentation. This will definitely
  include your SRS and your other project documents (design documents, like MG,
  MIS, etc). You can include these even before they are written, since by the
  time the project is done, they will be written. You can create BibTeX entries
  for your documents and within those entries include a hyperlink to the
  documents.}

\wss{Don't just list the other documents.  You should explain why they are relevant and
  how they relate to your VnV efforts.}

\section{Plan}

This section outlines the overall Verification and Validation (V\&V) plan for
the \textbf{RoCam} project. It defines the structure, responsibilities, and
methods used to verify that the system meets its functional and non-functional
requirements and to validate that it fulfills stakeholder needs. The section
covers the verification of the SRS, design, implementation, and automated
testing processes, as well as the validation strategy through stakeholder
reviews and field testing. Its purpose is to provide a clear, organized
framework ensuring that all aspects of RoCam are systematically tested,
reviewed, and proven reliable before final deployment. \wss{Introduce this
  section. You can provide a roadmap of the sections to come.}

\subsection{SRS Verification}

The SRS verification will focus on verify whether the system design satisfy all
functional and non-functional requirements, stakeholder needs, scope of work
and constraints specified. The SRS verification will be conducted through the
following steps:

\subsubsection{functional and Non-Functional Requirement Review}
Since the Design function will evaluate in detail whether the system align with
the functional and non-functional requirements. The SRS verification will focus
on verify the system design as a whole against the requirements. It will be
implemented as integration test in the final stages of development.

\subsubsection{Stakeholder Review}
Several review sessions will be schedules with the stakeholders, such as Dr.
Shahin Sirouspour, the McMaster Rocketry Team. Our team can revise the future
feature implementation based on their feedback.

\subsubsection{Constraints and Scope of Work Review}
Several internal review sessions will be conducted to ensure that our system
design and implementation are within the defined scope of work and constraints
specified in the SRS document.

\wss{If you have a supervisor for the project, you shouldn't just say they will
  read over the SRS.  You should explain your structured approach to the review.
  Will you have a meeting?  What will you present?  What questions will you ask?
  Will you give them instructions for a task-based inspection?  Will you use your
  issue tracker?}

\wss{Maybe create an SRS checklist?}

\subsection{Design Verification}

The design verification process for the \textbf{RoCam} project ensures that the
proposed architecture, algorithms, and hardware interfaces satisfy all
functional and non-functional requirements before implementation. Design
verification activities will be conducted through structured design reviews,
peer evaluations, and the use of detailed verification checklists. The goal is
to confirm that the design meets the intended performance, reliability, and
safety objectives defined in the SRS.

\subsubsection*{Verification Plan}
The design verification will proceed in three main stages:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Internal Design Review:}
        Each subsystem (computer vision, control, and UI)
        will undergo an internal review by each team member. Each member must
        agree on the designed architecture, algorithms, and interfaces.
        Interfaces must be clearly defined for scalability.

  \item \textbf{Peer Review by Classmates:}
        A peer design review session will be conducted with other capstone
        teams to obtain external feedback.
        Reviewers will evaluate the system’s clarity, feasibility, and
        maintainability based on the shared design artifacts (block diagrams
        , interface specifications, and test plans).

  \item \textbf{Supervisor and TA Review:}
        The project supervisor and teaching assistants will review the
        finalized design to ensure compliance with academic standards,
        capstone expectations, and safety considerations.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Verification Artifacts}
Design verification will produce the following artifacts:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Verified design diagrams and interface specifications.
  \item Annotated review feedback forms from classmates and supervisor.
  \item Updated design documents reflecting corrections and improvements.
  \item Completed design verification checklists (see below).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Design Verification Checklist}
The following checklist will be used during design reviews to ensure
completeness and consistency across all modules:

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification}

The verification of the verification and validation (VnV) plan for the
\textbf{RoCam} project will be verified through testing and peer review from
peers and supervisors. Each iteration of feedbacks and improvements will be
tracked with github issues. The focus on the verification plan will ensure
functionality, performance metrics are adequately covered in design.

For the validation plan, it will be measured through a combination of field
tests and automated test cases. The automated test will make sure our program
functions as expected in the developing environment. The field test will be
used as our integration tests to validate the entire system.

\wss{The verification and validation plan is an artifact that should also be

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Implementation Verification}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static
  verification of the implementation.  Potential techniques include code
  walkthroughs, code inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\wss{The final class presentation in CAS 741 could be used as a code
  walkthrough.  There is also a possibility of using the final presentation (in
  CAS741) for a partial usability survey.}

The implementation verification for the \textbf{RoCam} project ensures that the
developed software and integrated hardware components correctly realize the
verified design. This phase confirms that the implemented system satisfies the
functional and non-functional requirements defined in the SRS through a
combination of structured testing, static verification, and peer review.

\subsubsection*{Dynamic Verification}
Dynamic verification activities focus on confirming that the system
behaves as intended under realistic operating conditions.
They include the following elements:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Unit Testing:}
        Each software module (vision processing, gimbal control, data
        recording, and UI management) will undergo unit testing to verify
        functional correctness in isolation.

  \item \textbf{Integration Testing:}
        Once individual modules are verified, integration tests will
        confirm proper data flow between subsystems (camera input
        $\rightarrow$ vision algorithm $\rightarrow$ gimbal control
        $\rightarrow$ UI).
        Tests will ensure synchronization, timing correctness, and
        robustness under real-time constraints.

  \item \textbf{System Testing:}
        Full-system field tests will validate end-to-end performance,
        including real-time video tracking, system state transitions
        (Idle, Armed, Tracking), and video recording accuracy at 1080p\,60\,fps.
        These tests correspond directly to the verification items in
        the SRS functional and performance requirements.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Static Verification}
Static verification will be performed throughout the implementation
phase to ensure that the codebase meets quality, safety,
nd maintainability standards before execution.
Planned techniques include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Code Walkthroughs:}
        Conducted during the final CAS~741 presentation, where each
        subsystem lead presents core implementation logic and design decisions.
        This serves as a semi-formal walkthrough for peer and instructor
        review, enabling early identification of potential design or coding issues.

  \item \textbf{Code Inspection:}
        Team members will review each other’s pull requests prior to
        merging into the main branch.
        Reviews will focus on coding standard compliance, potential
        logic errors, exception handling, and safety-critical sections
        (e.g., gimbal actuation and state transitions).

  \item \textbf{Static Analysis Tools:}
        Tools such as \texttt{clang-tidy}, \texttt{cppcheck}, and
        \texttt{pylint} will be used to detect memory leaks, uninitialized variables,
        and other common implementation defects.
        Results from static analysis will be logged and reviewed
        as part of the verification record.

  \item \textbf{Documentation Review:}
        The team will verify that all inline comments, module-level
        documentation, and API references are consistent with the design
        specification and user documentation requirements.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Presentation and Usability Review}
The final CAS~741 presentation will serve as both a
\textbf{code walkthrough} and a partial \textbf{usability evaluation}.
During the presentation, peers and instructors will observe live
system operation, assess user interface clarity, and provide
feedback on usability, responsiveness, and overall system behavior.
This qualitative feedback will be incorporated into the final
verification summary and used to refine user-facing components
prior to final submission.

\noindent
Together, these verification activities ensure that the RoCam
implementation is thoroughly tested, statically verified, and
validated against both its design and real-world performance expectations.

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

The RoCam project adopts a structured automated testing approach that
prioritizes maintainability, integration compatibility, and developer
productivity. The selection of testing frameworks was guided by three key
criteria: (1) \textbf{ecosystem compatibility}, ensuring each tool aligns with
its respective language and runtime; (2) \textbf{ease of automation}, to
integrate smoothly with CI/CD pipelines; and (3) \textbf{scalability}, so that
test coverage can expand as the project evolves. These principles ensure a
consistent and reliable testing environment across backend, frontend, and
end-to-end validation stages.

Each subsystem of RoCam employs tools optimized for its function and
implementation language: \textbf{Testing Frameworks:} \\
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Backend (Python):} The project uses \textbf{Pytest} for unit testing due
        to its simplicity, readability, and powerful plugin system. It supports fixture
        management and integrates easily with coverage analysis and mock testing.
  \item \textbf{Frontend (React/TypeScript):} The project uses \textbf{Jest}, which is
        tightly integrated with React and TypeScript. It enables rapid component testing,
        snapshot validation, and ensures that UI logic behaves as expected across updates.
  \item \textbf{System-Level and Web UI:} The project uses \textbf{Playwright} for
        end-to-end (E2E) and Web UI testing. Playwright enables simulation of realistic
        operator workflows such as arming, tracking, and recording, ensuring smooth
        coordination between the frontend, backend, and physical hardware layers.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Code Coverage and Reporting Plan:} \\
Coverage analysis is conducted using the following tools:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{pytest-cov:} Provides granular coverage reporting for Python code,
        including line, branch, and function-level metrics, seamlessly integrated with
        Pytest test runs.
  \item \textbf{Jest (built-in coverage):} Tracks statement, branch, and function coverage
        for TypeScript components and produces standardized reports that align with Python
        output formats for unified tracking.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Linters and Formatters:} \\
To maintain coding standards and prevent stylistic or logical errors, RoCam enforces
consistent linting and formatting across both stacks:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Python:} Uses \textbf{Ruff} and \textbf{Black} for linting and code
        formatting to enforce PEP 8 compliance and maintain readability.
  \item \textbf{Frontend (TypeScript):} Uses \textbf{ESLint} and \textbf{Prettier} to
        maintain uniform style rules and detect syntax or logical inconsistencies.
\end{itemize}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{If you have already done this in the development plan, you can point to
  that document.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation}

Software validation confirms that \textbf{RoCam} satisfies stakeholder needs
and accurately implements the intended use cases (``building the right
system''). Validation complements verification and is referenced to the SRS
goals nd stakeholder roles.

\subsubsection*{Stakeholder Reviews and Task-Based Inspection}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Requirements Walkthroughs:} Scheduled reviews of the SRS
        and UI wireframes with the McMaster Rocketry Team (client) to confirm
        scope, priorities, and acceptance criteria.
  \item \textbf{Task-Based Inspection:} Stakeholders perform
        representative tasks (arm system, initiate tracking, stop tracking, export
        footage) while observers record issues, ambiguities, and unmet expectations.
  \item \textbf{Peer Reviews:} Classmate reviews focus on clarity,
        testability, and completeness (per CAS~741 guidance); all feedback and
        resolutions are logged.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Field and Demo-Based Validation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Rev~0/PoC Demo:} Used to validate that early
        functionality aligns with stakeholder expectations (e.g., preview
        latency, arm/track state semantics). Post-demo debrief captures change
        requests.
  \item \textbf{Supervisor Validation:} A focused session shortly
        after Rev~0 to confirm that the demonstrable behaviors match the
        SRS’s product use cases and performance intent.
  \item \textbf{User (Operator) Sessions:} ``Hallway'' usability
        checks with camera operators validate readability in outdoor-like
        conditions and UI flow (single-page ops without scrolling on 1920$\times$1080).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{External Data and Bench Validation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Reference Footage:} Where live launches are unavailable,
        public model-rocket videos and internally recorded dry-runs are used
        to validate detection/tracking logic and reacquisition behavior.
  \item \textbf{Synthetic Scenarios:} Scripted clips with
        occlusion/smoke/backlight and varying apparent rocket sizes validate
        robustness claims prior to field tests.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Acceptance and Traceability}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Acceptance Criteria:} Derived from the SRS (e.g.,
        sustained 1080p\,60\,fps I/O, end-to-end latency $\leq 120$\,ms,
        successful tracking through nominal flight phases, recording with a
        ngle overlays).
  \item \textbf{Traceability:} Validation tests map to SRS goals and
        stakeholder needs; a table links each validation activity to the
        corresponding SRS item(s) and planned evidence (videos, logs, checklists).
\end{itemize}

\noindent
If no suitable external datasets are available for certain scenarios,
this limitation will be stated explicitly; in those cases, validation
will rely on stakeholder task-based inspections and controlled synthetic
footage. This section also references the SRS verification section for
consistency checks between validated behaviors and specified requirements.

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\wss{You might want to use review sessions with the stakeholder to check that
  the requirements document captures the right requirements.  Maybe task based
  inspection?}

\wss{For those capstone teams with an external supervisor, the Rev 0 demo should
  be used as an opportunity to validate the requirements.  You should plan on
  demonstrating your project to your supervisor shortly after the scheduled Rev 0 demo.
  The feedback from your supervisor will be very useful for improving your project.}

\wss{For teams without an external supervisor, user testing can serve the same purpose
  as a Rev 0 demo for the supervisor.}

\wss{This section might reference back to the SRS verification section.}

\section{System Tests}

\wss{There should be text between all headings, even if it is just a roadmap of
  the contents of the subsections.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
  different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
  level of document structure can be removed.}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}

\wss{It would be nice to have a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.  If a section
  covers tests for input constraints, you should reference the data constraints
  table in the SRS.}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
  necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy.}

\wss{For some nonfunctional tests, you won't be setting a target threshold for
  passing the test, but rather describing the experiment you will do to measure
  the quality for different inputs.  For instance, you could measure speed versus
  the problem size.  The output of the test isn't pass/fail, but rather a summary
  table or graph.}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

\wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
  format for the tests given below.}

\wss{If you introduce static tests in your plan, you need to provide details.
  How will they be done?  In cases like code (or document) walkthroughs, who will
  be involved? Be specific.}

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

\wss{Provide a table that shows which test cases are supporting which
  requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
  philosophy for test case selection.}

\wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.
  For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you
  can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building
  approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour
  and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input
  and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code
  needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}
