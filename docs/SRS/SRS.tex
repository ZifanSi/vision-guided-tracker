\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}

Student and amateur rocketry teams, launch organizers, and technical judges
need reliable, high-fidelity visual evidence of rocket flights to analyze
staging behavior, parachute deployment, and flight anomalies that occur at
extreme speeds and altitudes. Manual camera operation is impractical in these
conditions, and existing tools (manual PTZ/GPS-centric systems) often fail to
maintain visual lock on small, fast-moving vehicles. This project addresses
this gap with an autonomous, vision-based tracking camera designed to lock onto
and follow rockets from launch through landing, providing real-time and
recorded footage for post-flight analysis and event operations.

\subsection{Goals of the Project}

\textbf{Purpose:}

Develop a software+hardware stack (the system) that is able to command a gimbal
with a camera mounted on it to track and record model rocket launches.

\textbf{Advantage:}

The system provides insights into the flight performance by having high quality
flight footage.

\textbf{Measure:}

Deploy the system at small-scale model rocket launch site with apogee less than
200 meters. The system should provide higher quality flight footage than the
manual camera operation.

\subsection{Personas}

\subsubsection*{Alexis Andrade}

\textbf{Age}: 28

\textbf{Role}: Camera Operator

Alexis works as an industrial automation technician in Hamilton, Ontario, where
she designs and maintains robotic assembly systems for a manufacturing firm.
Outside of work, her real passion lies in high-speed imaging and experimental
photography — a hobby that naturally led her to volunteer as a staff camera
operator at university rocketry competitions. She loves the mix of engineering
precision and adrenaline that comes with capturing a successful rocket launch.

She lives with her partner and their energetic border collie, Pixel. Alexis
spends her weekends hiking the Bruce Trail, refurbishing vintage lenses, or
volunteering at local maker fairs. Her favorite food is falafel, and she always
packs a thermos of strong coffee for early launch mornings. She listens to
synthwave and retro electronic music on long drives to test sites, finding it
helps her stay calm and focused.

Alexis is confident with technology but prefers systems that are reliable and
straightforward. She values hands-on work, hates clunky software interfaces,
and believes in simplicity over flashiness. “If I need a manual,” she likes to
say, “the interface is wrong.” Her cool temperament and technical precision
make her a trusted member of the launch operations crew.

\subsubsection*{Brandon Brooks}

\textbf{Age}: 23

\textbf{Role}: Flight Performance Analyst

Brandon is in his final year of mechanical engineering at a Canadian university
and serves as a flight performance analyst for his rocketry team. His specialty
is reconstructing flight profiles from sensor data and camera footage to
understand how the rocket behaves during ascent and descent. He joined the team
for the engineering challenge but stayed because he loves the mix of theory,
experimentation, and teamwork.

Originally from Calgary, Brandon now lives in a small off-campus apartment
filled with model rockets, whiteboards, and a curious cat named Fourier. He's
known for his patience and meticulous documentation — traits that make him the
go-to person for post-launch analysis. When he's not studying or coding MATLAB
scripts, he's cooking ramen, taking photos, or biking along Lake Ontario.

Brandon listens to ambient and post-rock while he works, loves strong coffee,
and dislikes chaotic testing days where data logging gets overlooked. His
attitude toward technology is analytical but practical: he values transparency,
well-documented systems, and data that “speaks for itself.” For him, every
successful flight is a story written in numbers and motion.

\subsubsection*{Christopher Chou}

\textbf{Age}: 59

\textbf{Role}: Event Organizer / Live Stream Technician

Christopher is a retired broadcast engineer who spent three decades working in
television production for CBC Toronto. After retirement, he moved to Burlington
and found a new passion in volunteer work, helping organize live streams and
event logistics for student rocketry competitions. For him, it's the perfect
blend of his lifelong love of broadcasting and his fascination with aerospace
technology.

He's married with two grown children who live abroad, and he often jokes that
the rocketry community has become his “third family.” Christopher loves cooking
Cantonese comfort food — especially steamed dumplings and congee — and enjoys
jazz and classic rock in equal measure. He spends his spare time restoring old
audio equipment, gardening, and taking long weekend drives along the Niagara
Escarpment.

Christopher's approach to technology is deeply pragmatic: he respects
automation but insists that every system should have a manual override. He
likes tidy wiring, clear documentation, and software that doesn't crash
midstream. He dislikes unnecessary complexity and “updates that fix what wasn't
broken.” To younger team members, he's both a mentor and the steady hand who
keeps the broadcast running when chaos hits.

Spaceport America in New Mexico.

The tracking camera will be operated at outdoor launch sites, typically in wide
open fields or designated rocket ranges. Launches occur only under clear, sunny
conditions with few or no clouds.

Additionally, users often wear hearing protection devices to mitigate high
acoustic noise from tools, filling tanks, and generators.

Launch sites are typically in a remote area, with limited or no internet
access.

\section{Relevant Facts And Assumptions}
\subsection{Relevant Facts}

None.

\subsection{Business Rules}

None.

\subsection{Assumptions}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item[AS-1] The system will not be connected to the public internet; thus, no
        authentication is required.
  \item[AS-2] The system will only be physically accessed by authorized personnel.
  \item[AS-3] Only one rocket will be flying at a time.
  \item[AS-4] The gimbal connected to the system has adequate performance to track the
        rocket (e.g., it can turn fast enough and has enough range of motion).
  \item[AS-5] 110V AC power is available at the launch site.
  \item[AS-6] It will always be sunny at the launch site, because the launch would be
        cancelled in case of bad weather.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Scope of the Work}
\subsection{The Current Situation}

Currently, the process of recording and analyzing rocket flights relies on
manual camera operators positioned at safe distances from the launch pad. These
operators attempt to visually follow the rocket during ascent and descent using
consumer or semi-professional video cameras mounted on tripods or pan-tilt
systems.

This approach suffers from several limitations:

\textbf{Accuracy:} Human reaction time and limited field of view make it nearly
impossible to keep fast-moving rockets (often exceeding Mach speeds) centered
in frame. The footage is frequently lost during liftoff or staging events,
leaving gaps in post-flight analysis.

\textbf{Safety Constraints:} Because a human operator must be physically present, camera
placement is restricted to safe zones, which may not provide optimal viewing
angles. Cameras cannot always be positioned where the best line-of-sight
exists.

\textbf{Operational Overhead:} Each launch requires trained operators, setup time, and
coordination with the launch control team. Fatigue, stress, and environmental
conditions (sun glare, wind, dust) further degrade performance.

\textbf{Data Quality:} The video produced by manual operators is often shaky,
inconsistently framed, and lacking synchronization with other flight data
(e.g., telemetry or gimbal angle). This reduces its value for engineering
analysis and competition reporting.

        \textbf{Fit Criterion:} The system enters the tracking state when a moving rocket is detected.\\
        \textbf{Source PUC:} PUC 2.3, PUC 3 \\
        \textbf{Priority:} High

  \item[FR-5] \emph{If the system is in the tracking state and the rocket is lost, the
          system must automatically return to the idle state.}\\[2mm]
        \textbf{Rationale:} Automatically reverting to idle prevents unnecessary gimbal movement and prepares the system for future launches or manual intervention.\\
        \textbf{Fit Criterion:} Upon loss of the rocket target, the system transitions from tracking to idle state without manual input.\\
        \textbf{Source PUC:} PUC 3 \\
        \textbf{Priority:} High

  \item[FR-6] \emph{When in the idle state, the system must allow the user to manually
          control the gimbal.}\\[2mm]
        \textbf{Rationale:} Manual gimbal control is necessary for arming the camera to the launch pad before the rocket is launched.\\
        \textbf{Fit Criterion:} In idle mode, the user can issue manual pan/tilt commands that are reflected in real-time by the gimbal hardware.\\

None.

\section{Open Issues}

- is it possible to reliably track a small rocket fast enough given the current technology?

\section{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
\subsection{Ready-Made Products}

- there are no off-the-shelf solutions that is capable of tracking a small and fast moving rocket.

\subsection{Reusable Components}

- computer vision algorithms

\subsection{Products That Can Be Copied}

- UI can take inspiration from other tracking systems (surveillance cameras, drones)

\section{New Problems}
\subsection{Effects on the Current Environment}

- the system shouldn't have any negative effects on the current environment

\subsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}

- The system interfaces with the existing live stream equipment using HDMI. No negative effects are expected because HDMI is an industry standard interface.

\subsection{Potential User Problems}

- If the system lost the rocket, the live stream technician will not be happy
