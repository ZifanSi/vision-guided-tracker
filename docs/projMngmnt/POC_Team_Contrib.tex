\maketitle

This document summarizes the contributions of each team member up to the POC
Demo. The time period of interest is the time between the beginning of the term
and the POC demo.

\section{Demo Plans}

\wss{What will you be demonstrating}
We will present an end-to-end proof-of-concept for \progname{} (“RoCam”), spanning video acquisition, real-time target detection/tracking, closed-loop gimbal control, and the operator UI. During the demo, a Jetson ingests a live 720p camera feed; an on-device preview window on the Jetson displays the stream together with key telemetry (FPS, end-to-end latency, gimbal angles/commands) and overlays (bounding box and confidence). The YOLO-series tracker outputs the target location; with a PID controller we issue smoothed follow commands so the target remains near the frame center. When the printed rocket drifts away from center, the gimbal moves the camera and continues tracking. The demo includes one manual takeover and one autonomous tracking segment to demonstrate the implemented core functionality.

We will verify three quantitative metrics: (1) real-time performance, with end-to-end latency of approximately 100--500\,ms; (2) stability, where for at least 10\,s of continuous tracking the target center remains within $\pm 15\%$ of the frame center; and (3) closed-loop accuracy, with gimbal pointing error not exceeding $3^\circ$--$5^\circ$. We will also record and display the processing frame rate (targeting $\geq 15$\,FPS). After the demo we will submit an evidence package including screen recordings/videos, UI screenshots with overlays, and time-stamped logs (FPS, latency, angles, commands) for reproducibility and verification.

The demo environment is a Jetson Orin with a custom PCB and a custom gimbal; the target is a printed rocket image. We connect to the Jetson over SSH to launch the programs. For degradation/fallback, when poor lighting or weak texture reduces detection confidence, we lower the detection threshold (and, if needed, relax smoothing) to maintain tracking; the operator can temporarily take manual control and the system will resume closed-loop tracking when the target is re-acquired.


\section{Team Meeting Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many team meetings have they attended over the
  time period of interest.  This number should be determined from the meeting
  issues in the team's repo.  The first entry in the table should be the total
  number of team meetings held by the team.}

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Student} & \textbf{Meetings} \\
    \midrule

\section{Supervisor/Stakeholder Meeting Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many supervisor/stakeholder team meetings have
  they attended over the time period of interest.  This number should be determined
  from the supervisor meeting issues in the team's repo.  The first entry in the
  table should be the total number of supervisor and team meetings held by the
  team.  If there is no supervisor, there will usually be meetings with
  stakeholders (potential users) that can serve a similar purpose.}

\section{CICD}

We use GitHub Actions with four workflows that cover documentation, firmware, and the operator UI.

\paragraph{build-tex (push to \texttt{main}, \texttt{docs/**}, or manual)}
Compiles LaTeX with TeX~Live~2025 on Ubuntu and commits the built PDFs back to the repository.
The job runs \texttt{make -B} under \texttt{docs/} and then auto-commits any updated \texttt{.pdf} files
(\texttt{contents: write}).

\paragraph{check-tex (pull requests touching \texttt{docs/**})}
Validates that the LaTeX compiles on PRs, uploads any changed PDFs as an artifact, then formats all
\texttt{.tex} sources with \texttt{latexindent} (80-column wrapping) and commits the formatting changes.
This keeps the documentation reproducible and consistently formatted.

\paragraph{firmware-ci (push/PR under \texttt{src/pcb-firmware/**})}
Builds the embedded firmware with Cargo on Ubuntu and uploads the resulting binary as an artifact.
The job also enforces Rust source formatting via \texttt{cargo fmt --check}.

\paragraph{react-ci (push/PR for the React app)}
Builds and smoke-tests the operator UI on Node~20. Dependencies are installed with \texttt{npm ci};
a lightweight \texttt{ci:smoke} runs on every change. Unit tests and production build currently run in
\emph{best-effort} mode (non-blocking), and any build artifacts are uploaded when present.

\paragraph{Near-term roadmap (to be enforced via branch protection)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Formatting gates:} add \texttt{black --check} for Python sources and \texttt{prettier --check} for the React codebase. If formatting is not clean, the PR will fail and be blocked from merging.
  \item \textbf{Cross-platform test matrix:} add a Python test job that runs the full unit test suite (15 tests) on
  \{\texttt{ubuntu-latest}, \texttt{macos-latest}, \texttt{windows-latest}\} $\times$
  Python \{3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13\}. The job will install dependencies and execute the tests; failures will block merges.
\end{itemize}


\section{Team Charter Trigger Items}

\wss{Provide a summary of the quantified triggers identified in the team's
  charter.}

\wss{Provide a list of any violations of the triggers.  If the team wishes, the
  violations can be summarized on aggregate, instead of naming specific team
  members.}

\wss{Provide a plan to address the violations.  This could include revising the
  triggers, if they are found to be too weak, strong or ambiguous.}

\section{Additional Productivity Metrics}

\wss{If your team has additional metrics of productivity, please feel free to
  add them to this report.}
