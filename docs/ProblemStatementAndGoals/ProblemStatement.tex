\section{Problem Statement}
This section outlines the motivation and context behind our project, ROCAM
(Rocket Optical Camera and Motion tracking). It defines the specific
engineering problem of achieving reliable, real-time visual tracking for
small-scale model rockets using a gimbal-mounted optical camera system.
It also identifies the inputs and outputs of ROCAM, such as live camera
feeds, gimbal state data, and stabilized video streams, and states the
performance objectives and key stakeholders involved in its development.
The goal is to enable accurate mid-flight observation for analysis of
staging and parachute deployment, thereby improving both safety and
performance in future rocket launches.

  information.}

\subsection{Problem}

In model rocketry, two of the hardest engineering problems are staging failures
and parachute tangling. These problems are hard to study because they happen in
mid-flight, where direct observation is limited. Without reliable tracking,
engineers cannot fully understand these failures or design better solutions. As
a result, recurring issues remain unresolved, slowing progress in both safety
and performance of future rockets.

Model rockets travel at very high speeds, sometimes faster than Mach 3 and over
100 km in altitude \citep{SpaceConcordiaRocketry2025}. Under these conditions,
manual camera tracking is not possible.

Tracking a small model rocket is even harder than tracking large rockets such as
the Falcon 9. Smaller size and uncontrolled launch conditions make accurate
detection and continuous tracking much more difficult.

Some commercial tracking systems exist \citep{AverTR3XX2021}, but they lack the
speed and precision needed for small, fast-moving rockets. To address this gap,
our project, ROCAM, aims to develop a real-time camera tracking system that can
automatically follow model rockets during flight for clear mid-air observation.


\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Inputs}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Realtime camera feed of the rocket during flight
          \item State information from the camera gimbal (a motorized mount that stabilizes and aims the camera)
          \item Manual camera gimbal adjustment commands from user
        \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Outputs}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Commands that move the camera gimbal to keep the rocket in frame
          \item Real time video preview for the operator
          \item Real time stabilized video output to the live streaming equipment
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance Objectives}
\label{sec:performance}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The system should be able to process a 1080p 60 fps input video feed from the camera
  \item The System should be able to output 1080p 60fps to the live streaming equipment
  \item Real time video preview should be at least 15fps
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Stakeholders}

\subsubsection*{\color{blue}{Direct Stakeholders}}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{McMaster Rocketry Team}: The primary end users who will deploy
    the system during launches. They rely on accurate real-time tracking to analyze
    staging events, parachute deployment, and overall flight performance.

    \item \textbf{Faculty Supervisor}: Provides technical guidance, project
    oversight, and mentorship. Dr.~Shahin Sirouspour serves in this role, ensuring
    that the project aligns with academic standards, engineering best practices,
    and capstone deliverable expectations.


\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{\color{blue}{Indirect Stakeholders}}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Aerospace Engineers and Researchers}: Benefit from
        high-quality flight footage to validate models, improve rocket
        designs, and support experimental research.

  \item \textbf{Event Organizers and Safety Officers}: Rely on
        reliable tracking for live monitoring of rocket flights,
        particularly for confirming parachute deployment and safe
        recovery during launch events.

  \item \textbf{Engineering and Robotics Community}: May adapt the
        system’s design principles for other domains requiring precise
        tracking of fast-moving objects, such as UAV navigation, sports
        analytics, or autonomous robotics.

  \item \textbf{Potential Commercial and Industrial Users}: Could
        adopt the system for broader applications in surveillance,
        wildlife monitoring, or industrial inspections where real-time
        vision-guided tracking is valuable.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Deployment Environment}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Outdoor rocket launch sites with variable lighting, wind, and dynamic
        backgrounds.
  \item Indoor lab-based testing and demonstration for development and evaluation.
\end{itemize}

\section{Goals}

The goal of this project is to design and implement ROCAM, a real-time camera
tracking system that automatically detects and follows small-scale model
rockets during launch, ascent, and descent (apogee < 200 m). The system aims to
maintain a stable visual lock on the rocket using a motorized gimbal, process a
1080p 60 fps video feed in real time, and output both live and recorded
stabilized footage. By meeting these goals, ROCAM will provide clear mid-flight
visual data to support analysis of staging events, parachute deployment, and
overall flight performance.


\section{Stretch Goals}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Handle 4K 60fps camera stream.
  \item Include functionalities to control the zoom and the focus of more advanced
        cameras.
  \item Integration with a full-size gimbal developed by the McMaster Rocketry Team.
  \item Track high-powered model rocket launches (apogee 3km+), while achieving all the
        performance objectives listed in Section \ref{sec:performance}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Extras}
In addition to the core goals of ROCAM, our team plans to include a few
value-added components that enhance the overall quality and usability of the
system. These extras aim to demonstrate practical integration between hardware
and software, improve accessibility for end users, and provide clearer insight
into the system’s design and operation. The selected extras include the design
of the control circuit used to drive the gimbal actuators and the creation of a
user instructional video for system setup and operation.

\wss{Teams may wish to include extras as either potential bonus grades, or to
  make up for a less advanced challenge level.  Potential extras
  include usability
  testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof, GenderMag
  personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Normally the maximum number of extras will be
  two.  Approval of the extras will be part of the discussion with
  the instructor
  for approving the project. The extras, with the approval (or request) of the
  instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}

\subsection{Circuit Design}

As this project requires the use of a mechanical gimbal, an electrical circuit
is needed to interface between the host computer and the gimbal actuators. The
circuit will handle motor control, feedback sensing, and communication with the
main software to enable precise and stable camera movement.

\subsection{User Instructional Video}

An user instructional video will be created to help potential users to
understand how to use the system.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\subsection*{\color{blue}{Jianqing Liu}}

\textbf{What went well while writing this deliverable?}  
I worked on most sections of this deliverable except the stakeholders and
environment parts. The writing process went smoothly overall, and my teammates
gave helpful feedback that made the document clearer. Adding the “Performance
Objectives” section helped explain what we mean by high performance and made
the project goals more specific.

\textbf{What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how did you resolve them?}  
Writing the “Problem” section was the hardest part because model rocketry is
not something most people know well. I rewrote it several times based on
feedback to make it easier to understand. There were also some small
disagreements about the environment section, but we talked them through with a
TA and resolved everything.


\subsection*{\color{blue}{Xiaotian Lou}}

\textbf{What went well while writing this deliverable?}  
Our team had a clear plan from the start and divided the work fairly. Everyone
was open to giving and receiving feedback, which made collaboration easy. We
were also able to reach our supervisor early, which helped confirm that we were
on the right track.

\textbf{What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how did you resolve them?}  
It took some time to get comfortable writing in \LaTeX{} and learning the
template format. We solved this by using shared examples and helping each other
fix formatting issues. Some sections felt unclear at first, but after team
meetings and supervisor feedback, we refined them and made everything flow
better.


\subsection*{\color{blue}{Shike Chen}}

\textbf{What went well while writing this deliverable?}  
Our team worked really well together and shared the same goals for the project.
Everyone contributed, and communication was good, which made it easier to
finish each section on time.

\textbf{What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how did you resolve them?}  
It was tricky to decide what “high-performance” should mean for our project.
That affects how complex the system needs to be. We discussed it as a team and
agreed on a clear definition and some measurable goals so that the project stays
realistic for the capstone timeline.


\subsection*{\color{blue}{Zifan Si}}

\textbf{What went well while writing this deliverable?}  
As the main editor of this deliverable, I thought my teammates shared many great
ideas that made the document stronger. Each section came together well, and it
was satisfying to combine everyone’s work into a clear and organized final
version.

\textbf{What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how did you resolve them?}  
The hardest part was getting feedback on time so I could update everything
before the deadline. We solved this by setting small internal deadlines and
using GitHub to track edits. That helped us stay organized and finish the
deliverable smoothly.
